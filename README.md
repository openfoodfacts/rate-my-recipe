This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Setup JS env

If you're new to JavaScript environment, you might want to install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) which is a version manager for Node.js

You can follow the installation guide here: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating

After that, you will be able to run `nvm install <node version>` and `nvm use <node version>` to install and switch between node versions.

### Install the package manager

This project use `yarn` to manage library dependencies with

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

### Run the project

The following command will install all the dependencies and run the project in localhost:3000

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Set your locale

To see the English translation of the app in locale env, you can add a `.env.locale` file at the root of the project with the next variable.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_LANG=en
```
